IsoVec: Controlling the Relative Isomorphism of Word Embedding Spaces
======================

This is an implementation of the experiments and combination system presented
in:

  Controlling the Relative Isomorphism of Word Embedding
  Spaces](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.404/)**. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 6019â€“6033, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Requirements
--------
- python3
- pytorch
- sklearn
- scipy
- numpy
- indic-nlp-library 
- torchtext
--------

Setup
-------
- Download third party packages: `cd third_party && sh get_third_party.sh && cd ..`
    * Note: If you're on Mac with an M1 chip, word2vec might not build.  You can fix
    this by changing -march=native to **[-mcpu=apple-m1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65966969/why-does-march-native-not-work-on-apple-m1)**
    in word2vec's makefile, and subbing in **[getc\_unlocked and putc\_unlocked](https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec/pull/40)** for
    fgetc\_unlocked/fputc\_unlocked. You'll also need to use gshuf instead of
    shuf within src/train.py.
- Download and make data: `cd data && sh make_data.sh`
- Download and make train/dev/test dictionaries: `cd data/dicts && sh
  create_dicts.sh`

Usage
-------
To reproduce Table 1 in the paper (Baselines), run:
- `sh baseline.sh $system $lang $seed`
    * For instance, run `sh baseline.sh w2v uk 0` for offical word2vec trained on Ukrainian.
    * system choices: {isovec, w2v}
    * lang choices: {uk, bn, ta, en}
- Here is an example experiment for running Isovec:
    * Goal: Train a Ukrainian embedding space with RSIM-U, in reference to a fixed English space.
    * Step 1: Train the fixed English space with `sh baseline.sh isovec uk 0`
    * Step 2: Train the Ukrainian space with: `sh run-isovec.sh rsim-u uk en 0`
- Choices of Isovec training algorithm are `l2, proc-l2, proc-l2-init, rsim,
  rsim-init, rsim-u, evs-u` for L2, Proc-L2, Proc-L2+Init, RSIM, RSIM-U, and
  EVS-U as detailed in Section 4.3 and 4.4 of the paper.
